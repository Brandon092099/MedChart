# Project Proposal
## Hospital Management System

## MedChart

## MedChart is a hospital management system application that will allow employees to monitor patients based on their room numbers. It will have a variety of information available to employees about their patients, such as diagnosis, medication, test results, etc. Additionally, the employees will have extensive information about the rooms that they are assigned to, such as vacancy, appointments, and type of room. Employees will also be able to utilize a time clock system to track their hours, as well as having a message board to notify them of patient updates.
## The motivation for MedChart is to simplify and streamline the hospital management system. MedChart will solve confusion in the hospital, allowing employees to manage hospital rooms and patients with ease.
